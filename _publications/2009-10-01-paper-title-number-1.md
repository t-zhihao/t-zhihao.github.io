excerpt: >-
  The diagnosis of early memory decline presents a trade-off between rapid, single-scan assessments that are inaccurate and accurate, multi-year longitudinal studies that delay crucial intervention. Our approach resolves this by leveraging a large language model (LLM) to steer a diffusion model, generating high-fidelity, time-series brain imaging data from a single scan. This process creates a self-improving data flywheel, where the synthetic data boosts diagnostic accuracy while simultaneously refining the LLM's generative capabilities.
