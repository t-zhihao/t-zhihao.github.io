excerpt: >-
The significant variance in the number of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) per patient creates a data imbalance that leads to biased and unreliable predictions from pathology foundation models, particularly for underrepresented cases. To mitigate this, we introduce a hierarchical diffusion model that generates high-quality 'virtual slide' representations by learning from the existing dataset. This data augmentation strategy effectively corrects for bias, enhancing the overall fairness and accuracy of the model.
