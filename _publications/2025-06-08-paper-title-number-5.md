excerpt: >-
  To address the lack of trust in "black-box" medical AI models and the safety risks of their overconfident predictions, we propose the ESAUT framework. ESAUT utilizes a convolution-enhanced Vision Transformer (ViT) for whole slide image analysis and introduces stochastic uncertainty to quantify prediction confidence. Furthermore, our post-hoc explainability method enhances transparency and trust by identifying the key image regions and cellular features that drive the model's decisions.
