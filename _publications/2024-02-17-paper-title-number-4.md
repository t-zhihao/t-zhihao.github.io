excerpt: >-
  The performance of deep learning models in pathology is often hindered by the sheer complexity of whole slide images, which includes their gigapixel scale, intricate biological patterns, and inherent noise. Our model tackles this by using a novel Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with a dual-pronged approach. First, it adopts a multimodal perspective by analyzing both the pathology image and a cell-network graph to capture complex patterns. Second, it quantifies an "uncertainty score" for each prediction, significantly improving clinical utility and trust by allowing physicians to flag uncertain cases for review.
